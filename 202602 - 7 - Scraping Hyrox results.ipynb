    "## Scraping & Verifying HYROX Results Across Seasons\n",
    "\n",
    "**Competitions:** HYROX Seasons 1–8 (Official Results Portal)  \n",
    "**Purpose:** Scrape all available race results and verify that every race, division, and gender has been successfully collected  \n",
    "**Methods:** Selenium automation, controlled multi-threading, dynamic pagination handling, structured CSV export, division detection, empty-file tracking, and race-level completeness checks  \n",

    "> This notebook builds a **robust scraping and verification pipeline** for HYROX competition results.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The workflow:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - 🌐 Scrapes race results directly from the official HYROX results platform  \n",
    "> - 🗂 Organises outputs by **Season, Race, and Division**  \n",
    "> - 🔄 Handles dynamic page loading and pagination safely  \n",
    "> - 📁 Saves structured CSV files for each race-division combination  \n",
    "> - ⚠️ Tracks empty divisions and failed scrapes  \n",
    "> - 🏁 Verifies that every race includes all the available divisions\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The objective of this notebook is to ensure **complete and reliable data extraction**, creating a solid foundation for downstream cleaning, validation, and analytical modelling in subsequent notebooks.\n",
