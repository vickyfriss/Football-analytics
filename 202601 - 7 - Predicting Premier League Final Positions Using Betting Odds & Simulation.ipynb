    "## 📈 Predicting Premier League Final Positions Using Betting Odds & Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Competition:** English Premier League 20  \n",
    "**Purpose:** Estimate probabilities of final league positions using betting market information and simulation  \n",
    "**Methods:** Odds-implied probabilities, Monte Carlo simulation, scenario analysis  \n",

    "> This notebook develops a probabilistic framework to predict final Premier League final positions using betting odds as market-based expectations.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Betting odds are transformed into implied probabilities and adjusted for bookmaker margin. These probabilities are then used to simulate the remainder of the season via Monte Carlo methods, generating distributions over final points totals and league positions.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The analysis focuses on estimating the likelihood of key outcomes such as title wins, top-four finishes, relegation, and mid-table placements. Results are presented at team level with uncertainty intervals, and the framework can be extended to incorporate form, fixture difficulty, or alternative predictive inputs beyond betting markets.\n"
